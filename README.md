# Bard-Discord-Bot

PaLM API in Discord.

Sort of working, I guess.

It'll listen at /bard command.

## Known issue:

- Longer messages seemed can't be sent, it'll put an error message: 

  ``discord.errors.HTTPException: 400 Bad Request (error code: 50035): Invalid Form Body
In content: Must be 2000 or fewer in length. ``
